# Community tools

## Slack

Slack has become a communication standard tool. We find it even more conveninent than mailing lists. Slack is standalone place, dedicated to echOpen, allowing subject focus channels, in place of mailing lists -> no hassle of emails follow-ups. 

* The channels

We standardized our documentation tools in order to generate harmoniously all the echOpen doc. For those accustomed to developer tools, this is like a doxygen. In this spirit, we fixed some standard rules such as **convention naming**. 
All the projects, either there are on github repos or exists as slack channels share a common prefix : `prj_*`. 

So, in addition to the classical **general** and **random** channels that come bound to each slack project, you'll find the following entities

* [prj_com_website](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_com_website) : dedicated to web site evolution focused on landing page and community enrollment

* [prj_commty_contrib](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_commty_contrib) : dedicated to contribution valorisation, contributor charter and guide.

* [prj_commty_disseminat](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_commty_disseminat) : dedicated to the "how to" dissemination at the kit level and at the community level  

* [prj_commty_is](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_commty_is) : dedicated to discuss documentation methods and processes. This is the Information System of echOpen

* [prj_commty_workspace](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_commty_workspace) : dedicated to making the echOpen Hôtel-Dieu location welcoming and friendly ;) if you're not in France, you should not worry about that.

* [prj_medtec_app](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_medtec_app) : dedicated to the Android App development : UX, UI, back-end

* [prj_medtec_medical](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_medtec_medical) : dedicated to all medical related issue : medical usages, probe ergonomy, clinical trials & such

* [prj_medtec_sigproc](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_medtec_sigproc) : dedicated to  signal processing, image denoising software tools

* [prj_publichealth_mpct](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_publichealth_mpct) : dedicated to echOpen's social impact and public health issues

* [prj_regul_norms](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_regul_norms) : dedicated to norms and certifications issues

* [rules_and_process](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/rules_and_process) : dedicated to contributors rules and process for hardware, software and such. Outcome : a complete guide

* [events_capx_andsuch](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/events_capx_andsuch) : dedicated to organize and announce, events, workshops, hackathons & such

* [usb](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/usb) : channel to dedicated to USB data transfer, will survive ?

*Remark* some of the channels do not begin by a `prj_` prefix. The reason that they are not project in the strict sense of the term and are not purposed to be included in a GitHub repo. **events_capx_andsuch**, related to organizing events is such an example.  

*If you're robot friendly, then you can script some that you'd consider to be relevant. It will be a joy ti test and adapot some robots in our family.*

## Basecamp

Basecamp is a project management tool. 

You'll find essentially two usages 

* "todo" : Basecamp offers a convenient way to categorize todo lists. This enables a dashboard-like panoramic view of current tasks adresses to each of the members of the team. 

* Message Boards : these are conversations about structured topics. Indeed, if Slack is the perfect tool to chat informally on any subject, when a topic emerges and needs that member teams exchange in a more detailed and structured way, then Basecamp Messages are the right place to launch threads. *Current threads are wirtten in french, we are now switching to english. Btw, don't hesitate to create threads when needed !*

* Basecamp offers also some daily alerts, inviting users to answer a daily question about "What did you work on today?", "See anything great lately that inspired you?". This is just perfect to maintain a team-builing rythm, and to keep all the community members informed of the current project advances.

## Facebook group

Sure, you know everything about how a facebook group works. To get there, click [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/echopen). You'll have to send a request. As soon as you're in, you'll find our online community. 

* What the facebook group is 

This space is where 

** the community members share shedules, (live) experiencing events, and other top stories. This feed is not only dedicated to echOpen *stricto sensu* news but any news, comments, comments on comments, are welcome as long as they are related to community subjects of concerns.

** the community members call for action or support. Indeed, any information that need to be known largely and publically has its place on the facebook page. A good example is the need to find some specific skills, or a technical support 

** you can invite your interested friend to join the group

** you can introduce yourself to the community in a brief or long post. 

* What the facebook group is not

** All the technical details are to be discussed on dedicated tools, such as Slack or Basecamp. If the details are relevant to appear on the facebook feed, then they correspond to the need for a community support or a community action. Even in this case, you should call for support and give all the technical details in MP. 


*Tautology : a facebook group is a group so that, all the common gentle•wo•men society rules of courtesy, kindness and critical mind apply ;)*
